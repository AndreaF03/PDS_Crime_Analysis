# PDS Crime Dataset Analysis 

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a crime dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to uncover insights, trends, and patterns related to crime distribution across time and location.

##  Dataset

The dataset is read from a CSV file . It includes columns such as:
- Crime Type
- Location
- Date and Time
- Reporting Agency
- And other relevant fields

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

##  Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Null value treatment
- Feature engineering (date formatting, column drops)
- Visualizations:
  - Crime trends over time
  - Location-wise crime counts
  - Heatmaps and correlation plots
- Insights drawn from temporal and categorical data

##  Key Findings

- Crimes increased/decreased during specific months/years
- Certain locations had significantly higher crime rates
- Correlation between different crime types or attributes

## Future Improvements

- Add predictive modeling or clustering
- Interactive visualizations (e.g., Plotly)
- Integration with geolocation maps
